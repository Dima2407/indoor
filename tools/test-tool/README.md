# Test-tool (Tester+Faker)

## By Oleksiy Grechnyev, Feb 2017

This is an integration test workbench for tracking_lib.

## Components:

* Tester : The program to process a measurement events file generated by Faker or Logger.
* Faker  : The program to generate a fake measurements events file for a polyline motion.
* Unit   : The full-auto version of Tester with CppUnit-based, TeamCity-compatible output.
* common_lib : Code shared by Tester, Faker, Unit (most of the code).

## Also includes

* tracking_lib   : Part of the Indoor SDK project.
* rapidjson_min  : A minimal version of Rapidjson (MIT license)

## System requirements:

* C++11 compiler (e.g. gcc 5+).
* cmake 3+
* make (For Unix/Linux/Cygwin/MSYS2)
* CppUnit (Unit only)

## How to build:

Build this cmake project with cmake. Upon a successful build, the executables "tester"
and "faker" appear in respective subdirectories of "build". 

### For Unix/Linux/Cygwin/MSYS2 with gcc+make:

cd test-tool

mkdir build

cd build

cmake ..

cmake --build .

You can also use a single-target syntax like

cmake --build . --target tester

This way you can build tester and/or faker even if you don't have CppUnit.

### For Windows+Visual Studio: 

See Windows Cmake docs.

### For a properly configured C++ IDE (CLion, Qt creator, Code::Blocks etc.):

Open/Import the test-tool directory as a "CMake project", build, run.
